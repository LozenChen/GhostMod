This Celeste mod is base on DemoJameson's [GhostMod](https://github.com/DemoJameson/GhostMod), which is a fork of Everest Team's [GhostMod](https://github.com/EverestAPI/GhostMod)

# How to use

Step1: Switch to RECORD mode manually, or use a StartGhostRecording command before the first frame in the tas file.

Step2: RESTART chapter or use a CONSOLE LOAD command to start your run to record. If you succeed, you will find a Recording Icon in the bottom-right of the screen.

Step3: Whenever you finishes a room, a Ghost file will be written to Storage.

Step4: Wait until your tas finishes, or use a StopGhostRecording command, to stop recording. Note that if the last recording room is not finished, then it will be dropped.

Step5: Switch to PLAY mode manually, and enter the same level, to play your records.

# Ghost Info HUD and Ghost Custom Info

- You can drag and move it.

- Ghost info HUD = the TAS Info HUD when you record the ghosts. So if you closes TAS Info HUD when recording ghosts, then Ghost info HUD will be empty.

- Ghost custom info are calculated when you record the ghosts. So when you are playing the Ghost files, changing the Custom Info Template will not provide you more info.

# Hotkey

- You can use hotkeys to switch modes.
